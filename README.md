# ian

ian is a file-based calendar and reminder system.
Quickly create and manage calendar events with the CLI program.
Synchronisation is easy to set up via VCS.
Distribution and management is accomplishable with a self-hosted server, that you can entirely configure from any ian client.
Configure your server to allow certain sections of your calendar to be shared to other ian clients or downloadable for external calendaring programs using the CalDAV protocol.
