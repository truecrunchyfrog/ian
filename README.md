# ian

(gregor)ian is a file-based calendar.
It strives for iCalendar RFC 5545 compatability (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545).
ian supports "sources": which are dynamic and subscribeable calendars:
* Native ian calendars.
* Dynamic (interactive) CalDAV calendars.
* Static iCalendars.

Quickly create and manage calendar events with the CLI program. Synchronisation is easy to set up via VCS.
Distribution and management is accomplishable with a self-hosted server, that you can entirely configure from any ian client.
Configure your server to allow certain sections of your calendar to be shared to other ian clients or downloadable for external calendaring programs using the CalDAV protocol.
